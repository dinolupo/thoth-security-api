            When the Security API is being used by a WAR, 
            will it protect only the WAR it's in or every WAR 
            deployed to the server?

            <b>Only this WAR!</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            JASPIC is really low-level and depending on how you register
            the <code>AuthConfigProvider</code> with the <code>AuthConfigFactory</code>,
            you can protect just the WAR the JASPIC code is in, every WAR
            deployed to the server, or one of the WARs deployed to the server.
            The Security API, however, doesn't work this way.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, when the Security API is used by a WAR, the Security API
            protects only that WAR.  Unlike
            JASPIC, there is no way (as of this writing August, 2017) to configure the 
            Security API to protect other other WARs on the server.            
        </p>
        <p>
            To test this, below you will see output from the logs of 
            <code>TestHttpAuthenticationMechanism</code>, which is used by this WAR.
            However, if you browse to
            <h:outputLink value="/#{applicationController.helloWorldTitle}/">#{applicationController.helloWorldTitle}</h:outputLink>
            and <code>tail</code> the log files (see above the location
            of the log files) you see no Security API code executes for either
            of of these applications.
